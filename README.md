# IndigoCS_Mandelbrot
C++ Mandelbrot image generator. Generates graphical representations of the Mandelbrot set in the PPM file format.

This is the code accompanying my [IndigoCS video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=entjSp3LIfQ) on YouTube. I meant to post it a long time ago, but I never did... Whoops!

The link on the video is not in the description, because at my university this is remarkably similar to one of the homework assignments, and I don't want people just downloading my code that easily. They'll probably still find it. If you are in one of those classes, be warned! Your professor certainly knows about this video by now.
